Hello! Welcome! I'm Vin, a big fan of the web, science, and mint chocolate chip. I built this site using AngularJS because... well, I wanted to mess with Angular! It's a neat framework with a lot of momentum, I highly recommend checking it out!</p> <p>In the meantime, this site will keep growing and changing as it discovers its purpose on the web. Isn't that uplifting?</p> <h3>Thanks for visiting!</h3> </div> </div>
